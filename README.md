About Me
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Santiago, and I am a final-year Economics student with a strong passion for data analysis and backend programming. I thrive on exploring the intersection between technology and economics, finding innovative ways to solve problems through code and data-driven insights.

I am highly motivated to share my knowledge with others while continuously learning and growing in my field. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and develop solutions that make a difference.

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently open to an internship or a new job opportunity where I can apply my skills, gain valuable experience, and further develop as a professional.

Feel free to connect with me and letâ€™s work together to achieve great things!

Let me know if youâ€™d like to add or adjust anything! ðŸ˜Š
